/**
 * The Alloy runtime, as much of it as a controller reaches.
 *
 * Transcribed from `Alloy/lib/alloy/controllers/BaseController.js` and the controller template.
 * `@types/titanium` covers Titanium and stops there, with no `Alloy` namespace at all, so a
 * declaration naming `Alloy.Controller` without this resolves to an error type — and an error type
 * for `$` takes every view member down with it.
 *
 * **This file is loaded, not generated.** The language service reads it as a library root, exactly
 * the way it reads `@types/titanium`, so it is real TypeScript with real tooling rather than a
 * template literal inside a module. What *is* generated beside it is only what cannot be known
 * ahead of time: the keys of `Alloy.CFG`, the translation keys, and the names this project's own
 * `createController`, `createModel`, `createCollection` and `createWidget` accept. Those go into
 * the same `declare namespace Alloy` block and merge with this one.
 *
 * It ships in the package rather than living under `src/`, for two reasons that both bite. The
 * tsconfig include pattern would pull these ambient declarations into this project's own
 * compilation, so `Alloy` would be a global in our source. And `tsc` does not copy a `.d.ts` it
 * was given as input into `outDir`, so a file under `src/` would be missing from the build
 * entirely. A test in `src/test/package/` asserts it is where the built package says it is.
 *
 * Types are named where the referent is knowable and left `unknown` where it is not. A view member
 * really can be either a Titanium proxy or a controller — `<Require>` and `<Widget>` both put a
 * controller on `$` — so the union is the honest answer rather than either half of it. A model's
 * attributes are the user's own schema, and there `unknown` is the honest answer: a confident
 * wrong type is worse than an admitted gap, and the view members beside it carry the types that
 * matter.
