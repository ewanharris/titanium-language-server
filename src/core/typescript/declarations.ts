/**
 * Which controller's `$` the language service currently has in scope.
 *
 * `generateViewDeclaration` turns a view into a declaration; this decides when one is installed,
 * when it is regenerated, and — the part that is easy to get wrong — when the previous one is
 * taken back out. **Every declaration declares `$`**, because that is what Alloy calls it in every
 * controller, so two in the same program is a duplicate identifier and the wrong view's ids on the
 * symbol besides. Exactly one is in scope at a time: the one for the controller being asked about.
 *
 * That invariant is the whole reason this is a class rather than a function. It is state — which
 * declaration is installed — and it has to be enforced across calls that know nothing about each
 * other, since the caller is a request handler answering whatever file the user's cursor is in.
 * `ProjectService.setGenerated` is deliberately generic, knowing only "content to read as a file",
 * so the Alloy half of the knowledge lives here and the TypeScript host stays free of it.
 *
 * One of these per project, beside the service it installs into.
